## Why this fork exists

Vue Google Maps Community Fork is a repository to keep the original [Vue Google Maps repository](https://github.com/fawmi/vue-google-maps) alive. The original repository is great but it wasn't maintained as the community wanted, so we decided to fork it because many of us depends on it.

We tried to contact Fawmi many times in different ways but we never got an answer. He did a great job and I'm sure we will be able to talk with him about all the situation. All we want is to keep this library alive and better and I'm sure Fawni would share the same feeling.

More info about the community decision [here](https://github.com/fawmi/vue-google-maps/issues/159).

## Welcome!

Hi! Vue Google Maps Community Fork is a communitary repository. It is a set of the most used Google Maps components made for VueJS 3.

If you are coming from Fawmi's repository please read [this discussion](https://github.com/NathanAP/vue-google-maps-community-fork/discussions/1) to get some info about the actual situation.

## Changelog

You can follow the official changelog [here](https://github.com/NathanAP/vue-google-maps-community-fork/discussions/6)!

## Documentation

You can find a detailed documentation [here](https://vue-google-maps-community-fork.netlify.app). It will show you how to use every component this library contains and demonstrate some examples for you.

Also, you can enter in [this discussion](https://github.com/NathanAP/vue-google-maps-community-fork/discussions/9) to talk about or read the documentation changelog.

It is in our plans to make it better and more detailed, but for now it might help you start using the library.

## Installation

You can install this library using this command:

```
npm install vue-google-maps-community-fork
```

## Basic usage

To use this library you will need an API Key. You can learn how to get an API Key [here](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/get-api-key).

### Configure Vue to use the Components

In your `main.js`

```js
import { createApp } from 'vue'
import VueGoogleMaps from 'vue-google-maps-community-fork'

const app = createApp(App)
app
  .use(VueGoogleMaps, {
    load: {
      key: 'YOUR_API_KEY_COMES_HERE',
    },
  })
  .mount('#app')
```

### AN IMPORTANT POINT ABOUT YOUR CONFIGURATION

You might be getting the following error:

`Requested module 'fast-deep-equal' does not provide an export named 'default'`

Please notice:

- [We are aware](https://github.com/NathanAP/vue-google-maps-community-fork/issues/4) of this problem.
- We hope that it will be fixed soon enough.
- To avoid it right now, you need to do this configuration in your `vite.config.js`:

```js
    optimizeDeps: {
        include: [
            "vue-google-maps-community-fork",
            "fast-deep-equal",
        ],
    },
```

- This **IS NOT** a fix. This is just a hack we are using to avoid the problem.
- Please subscribe to the issue to stay in touch with this problem

### Use it anywhere in your components

```vue
<template>
  <GMapMap :center="center" :zoom="7" map-type-id="terrain" style="width: 100vw; height: 900px">
  </GMapMap>
</template>

<script>
export default {
  name: 'App',
  data() {
    return {
      center: { lat: 51.093048, lng: 6.84212 },
    }
  },
}
</script>
```

## Components

### Markers

If you need to add markers to the `Map`, add `GMapMarker` as child of `GMapMap` component.

```vue
<template>
  <GMapMap :center="center" :zoom="7" map-type-id="terrain" style="width: 500px; height: 300px">
    <GMapMarker :key="marker.id" v-for="marker in markers" :position="marker.position" />
  </GMapMap>
</template>
<script>
export default {
  name: 'App',
  data() {
    return {
      center: { lat: 51.093048, lng: 6.84212 },
      markers: [
        {
          id: 'dfsldjl3r',
          position: {
            lat: 51.093048,
            lng: 6.84212,
          },
        },
      ],
    }
  },
}
</script>
```

### Cluster

If you have too many markers, it is helpful to cluster markers. You can easily cluster markers by wrapping your markers with `GMapCluster` component.

Note: clusters were not working in the original version of this package. All of the clusters are here because of the community fixes. If you're having trouble with it please [try using the docs](https://vue-google-maps-community-fork.netlify.app/components/cluster.html). Also, feel free to open discussions or issues to get help.

```vue
<template>
  <GMapMap :center="center" :zoom="7" map-type-id="terrain" style="width: 500px; height: 300px">
    <GMapCluster>
      <GMapMarker
        :key="index"
        v-for="(m, index) in markers"
        :position="m.position"
        :clickable="true"
        :draggable="true"
        @click="center = m.position"
      />
    </GMapCluster>
  </GMapMap>
</template>
<script>
export default {
  name: 'App',
  data() {
    return {
      center: { lat: 51.093048, lng: 6.84212 },
      markers: [
        {
          position: {
            lat: 51.093048,
            lng: 6.84212,
          },
        }, // A long list of clusters
      ],
    }
  },
}
</script>
```

### Heatmap

If you need to add heatmap layer to the Map, add visualization library in load config and add GMapHeatmap as child of GMapMap component.

```js
import { createApp } from 'vue'
import VueGoogleMaps from '@fawmi/vue-google-maps'

const app = createApp(App)
app
  .use(VueGoogleMaps, {
    load: {
      key: 'YOUR_API_KEY_COMES_HERE',
      libraries: 'visualization',
    },
  })
  .mount('#app')
```

```vue
<template>
  <GMapMap ref="myMapRef" :center="center" :zoom="zoom" style="width: 100%; height: 600px">
    <GMapHeatmap :data="heatData"></GMapHeatmap>
  </GMapMap>
</template>
<script>
export default {
  name: 'App',
  setup() {
    const center = { lat: 52.2985593, lng: 104.2455337 }
    const zoom = 12
    const myMapRef = ref()
    const heatData = ref([])

    watch(myMapRef, (googleMap) => {
      if (googleMap) {
        googleMap.$mapPromise.then((map) => {
          heatData.value = [
            { location: new google.maps.LatLng({ lat: 52.2985593, lng: 104.2455337 }) },
          ]
        })
      }
    })

    return {
      center,
      zoom,
      heatData,
      myMapRef,
    }
  },
}
</script>
```

## Access map object

If you want to access `google map` object, you can access it by getting ref of the map object.

```vue
<template>
  <GMapMap ref="myMapRef" />
</template>
<script>
export default {
  mounted() {
    console.log(this.$refs.myMapRef)
  },
}
</script>
```

### Map options

You can pass Map options using options property:

See [MapOptions](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/reference/map#MapOptions) for a complete list of available options.

```vue
<GMapMap
  :options="{
    zoomControl: true,
    mapTypeControl: false,
    scaleControl: false,
    streetViewControl: false,
    rotateControl: false,
    fullscreenControl: true,
    disableDefaultUi: false,
  }"
>
</GMapMap>
```

## More components

Many other components are also supported. Checkout [docs](https://vue-map.netlify.app) for more.

## Nuxt 3 usage

Warning: this is part of the old documentation and I never used Nuxt, please let me know if it will work properly this way.

In order to your Nuxt 3 project work properly with this library, you need to add `vue-google-maps-community-fork` to `build.transpile` property in your `nuxt.config.ts`.

Also, as pointed [here](https://github.com/NathanAP/vue-google-maps-community-fork/issues/14), you will need to add `@googlemaps/markercluster` into it as well for your builded project work properly.

Here is an example:

```ts
export default defineNuxtConfig({
  build: {
    transpile: ['vue-google-maps-community-fork', '@googlemaps/markercluster'],
  },
})
```

After that, you need to configure your plugin `~/plugin/vueGoogleMaps.ts`.

```ts
import { defineNuxtPlugin } from '#app'
import VueGoogleMaps from 'vue-google-maps-community-fork'

export default defineNuxtPlugin((nuxtApp) => {
  nuxtApp.vueApp.use(VueGoogleMaps, {
    load: {
      key: 'YOUR_API_KEY_COMES_HERE',
    },
  })
})
```
